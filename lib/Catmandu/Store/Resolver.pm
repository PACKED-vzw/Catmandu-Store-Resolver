=head1 DESCRIPTION

    # From a Catmandu Fix
    lookup_in_store(
        objectNumber,
        Resolver,
        username: username,
        password: password,
        url: http://www.resolver.be
    )

Configure the L<Resolver|https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/resolver> as a L<store|http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#stores> for L<Catmandu|http://librecat.org/>.

Museum objects and records require a PID to be uniquely identifiable. The Resolver tool
generates and resolves these PIDs. By using this store, PIDs can be queried (based on
the object number of the record as stored in the resolver), created, updated and deleted
from Catmandu.

The C<_id> attribute of the data after a L<add_to_store|Catmandu::Fix::add_to_store>
is set to the I<workPid>, which is the first item of the I<presistenURIs> array.

The I<Store> returns the following data:

    data:
        data_pids:
            - https://resolver.be/collection/work/data/9031
        documents:
            - 88682
            - 88683
        domain: https://resolver.be
        id: '9031'
        persistentURIs:
            - https://resolver.be/collection/9031
            - https://resolver.be/collection/9031/untitled
            - https://resolver.be/collection/work/data/9031/html
