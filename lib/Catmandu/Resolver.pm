=head1 DESCRIPTION

Configure the L<Resolver|https://github.com/PACKED-vzw/resolver> as a L<store|http://librecat.org/Catmandu/#stores> for L<Catmandu|http://librecat.org/>.

Museum objects and records require a PID to be uniquely identifiable. The Resolver tool
generates and resolves these PIDs. By using this store, PIDs can be queried (based on
the object number of the record as stored in the resolver), created, updated and deleted
from Catmandu.
